                    I'm a Chinese-American born & raised in Northern Virginia but I'm studying in the cool, cool Bay Area. This semester, I'm taking Korean 10A, which is my 3rd semester of Korean, and I'm really loving it! I'm an Internal officer for K-Popular, the K-pop club at Berkeley, so if you also like K-pop, come talk to me about it! My favorites are BTS and Sistar. I really love phone games, but in my free time when I'm not on YouTube or Tumblr, I also play League of Legends and Pokemon! I'm currently obsessed with Little Gem (Belgian waffles). I hope to travel the world someday, see exciting things & eat amazing foods.

                    This semester, I'm taking CS 162 (Operating Systems) and teaching CS 61A for my second time. I really enjoy teaching, so I'm also involved with CSM (Computer Science Mentors) as a Senior Mentor for 61A, developing content (worksheets and NEW explorations on Oppia) as well as mentoring Junior Mentors. I'm also the Student Relations officer for HKN (Eta Kappa Nu, the EECS honor society at Berkeley), so I represent the honor society at events and orientations, promote our services like tutoring, and orchestrate the delivery of hundreds of cookies to students after lower division EE and CS courses! In the future, I hope to work on designing applications that feel beautiful through ease of use, not just aesthetic.
